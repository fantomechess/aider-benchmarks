<thinking>
To implement the best_hands function, we need to consider the following:

1. Representation of poker hands
2. Ranking of poker hands
3. Comparison between hands
4. Handling ties

We'll assume that each hand is represented as a list of strings, where each string represents a card (e.g., "2H" for 2 of Hearts, "AS" for Ace of Spades).

We need to implement a way to:
1. Identify the type of hand (e.g., Full House, Flush, etc.)
2. Rank hands of the same type
3. Compare hands of different types
4. Return all hands that are tied for best

We'll use helper functions to break down the problem into manageable parts.
</thinking>

<breaking_thoughts>
1. We need to ensure our implementation can handle all types of poker hands, including edge cases like five-of-a-kind in games with wild cards.
2. The function should be able to handle an arbitrary number of hands, not just two.
3. We should consider performance implications for large numbers of hands.
4. The implementation should be clear and maintainable, possibly using classes or named tuples for better code organization.
5. We need to handle potential input errors gracefully.
6. The ranking system should be flexible enough to accommodate different poker variants if needed in the future.
</breaking_thoughts>

<reflection>
After reviewing the thought process, I believe the approach is sound. However, we should also consider:

1. Adding type hints for better code clarity and potential error catching.
2. Including docstrings for the main function and helper functions to explain their purpose and expected inputs/outputs.
3. Using constants for card values and suits to improve readability and maintainability.
4. Implementing unit tests to ensure the correctness of our implementation (though this is outside the scope of the current task).

Let's proceed with implementing the solution, keeping these considerations in mind.
</reflection>

<output>
Based on our analysis, here's the implementation for the best_hands function and its helper functions:

poker.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def best_hands(hands):
    pass
=======
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

# Constants for card values
VALUES = '23456789TJQKA'
SUITS = 'HDCS'

def best_hands(hands: List[str]) -> List[str]:
    """
    Determine which hands are the best among the given poker hands.
    
    :param hands: A list of poker hands, where each hand is a string of 5 cards separated by spaces.
    :return: A list of the best hand(s).
    """
    if not hands:
        return []
    
    ranked_hands = [(-hand_rank(hand.split()), hand) for hand in hands]
    return [h for r, h in ranked_hands if r == min(r for r, h in ranked_hands)]

def hand_rank(hand: List[str]) -> Tuple[int, List[int]]:
    """
    Calculate the rank of a poker hand.
    
    :param hand: A list of 5 card strings.
    :return: A tuple (rank, tiebreakers) where rank is the hand's rank and tiebreakers is a list of values for breaking ties.
    """
    card_values = [VALUES.index(card[0]) for card in hand]
    value_counts = Counter(card_values)
    counts = sorted(value_counts.values(), reverse=True)
    ranks = sorted(value_counts, key=lambda v: (value_counts[v], v), reverse=True)
    
    straight = len(set(card_values)) == 5 and max(card_values) - min(card_values) == 4
    flush = len(set(card[1] for card in hand)) == 1
    
    if straight and flush:
        return (8, ranks)
    if counts == [4, 1]:
        return (7, ranks)
    if counts == [3, 2]:
        return (6, ranks)
    if flush:
        return (5, ranks)
    if straight:
        return (4, ranks)
    if counts == [3, 1, 1]:
        return (3, ranks)
    if counts == [2, 2, 1]:
        return (2, ranks)
    if counts == [2, 1, 1, 1]:
        return (1, ranks)
    return (0, ranks)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This implementation includes:

1. Type hints for better code clarity.
2. Docstrings for the main function and helper function.
3. Constants for card values and suits.
4. A helper function `hand_rank` to determine the rank of a single hand.
5. The main `best_hands` function that uses `hand_rank` to compare hands and return the best one(s).

The `hand_rank` function returns a tuple where the first element is the rank of the hand (8 for straight flush, 7 for four of a kind, etc.), and the second element is a list of card values in order of importance for breaking ties.

The `best_hands` function uses `hand_rank` to rank all hands, then returns all hands that are tied for the best rank.

This implementation should correctly handle all types of poker hands, including ties, and can handle an arbitrary number of input hands.

<thinking>
The error messages indicate that we're trying to apply the unary minus operator (-) to a tuple, which is not a valid operation in Python. This is happening in the `best_hands` function when we try to create `ranked_hands`. 

The issue stems from our attempt to negate the entire tuple returned by `hand_rank`. Instead, we should only negate the first element of the tuple (the rank) and keep the second element (the tiebreaker list) as is.
</thinking>

<breaking_thoughts>
1. We need to modify how we create the `ranked_hands` list.
2. Instead of negating the entire tuple, we should negate only the first element.
3. We should ensure that this change doesn't affect the sorting logic.
4. We need to verify that this change will resolve all the test failures.
5. We should consider if this change might introduce any new edge cases or issues.
</breaking_thoughts>

<reflection>
After reviewing the thought process, I believe the proposed solution will resolve the immediate errors without introducing new issues. The change is minimal and maintains the original logic of the function. It addresses the core problem of trying to negate a tuple, which was causing the TypeError.
</reflection>

<output>
Let's modify the `best_hands` function in poker.py to fix the error. We'll change how we create the `ranked_hands` list:

poker.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    ranked_hands = [(-hand_rank(hand.split()), hand) for hand in hands]
    return [h for r, h in ranked_hands if r == min(r for r, h in ranked_hands)]
=======
    ranked_hands = [((-rank, tiebreakers), hand) for hand in hands for rank, tiebreakers in [hand_rank(hand.split())]]
    return [h for (_, _), h in ranked_hands if (_, _) == min(r for r, _ in ranked_hands)]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change does the following:
1. We unpack the tuple returned by `hand_rank` into `rank` and `tiebreakers`.
2. We create a new tuple `(-rank, tiebreakers)`, negating only the rank.
3. We use this new tuple as the sorting key, paired with the original hand.
4. In the return statement, we adjust the unpacking to match the new structure.

This modification should resolve the TypeError while maintaining the original sorting and comparison logic. The negation of the rank ensures that hands are still sorted from best (highest rank) to worst (lowest rank).
